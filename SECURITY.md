# Security Policy

## Overview

The SwapIT project handles real XLM and other assets through Soroban smart contracts. Security is critical to protect users' funds through every step of a swap.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow responsible disclosure practices.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** open a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, please report vulnerabilities via one of the following methods:

1. **Email**: Send a detailed report to security@swapit.io
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use the [Security Advisories](https://github.com/paul-motron/SwapIT/security/advisories/new) page

### What to Include

When reporting a vulnerability, please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fix (if available)
- Any relevant logs or screenshots

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receipt
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Depends on severity, typically 14-30 days

### Disclosure Process

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours
2. **Investigation**: Our team will investigate and validate the vulnerability
3. **Fix Development**: We will develop and test a fix
4. **Disclosure**: We will coordinate disclosure with you after the fix is deployed
5. **Credit**: We will credit you in the security advisory (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Security Best Practices for Users

### For Asset Owners (Sellers)

- **Keep your secret safe**: The secret used to create your commitment hash is the only way to unlock a swap. Store it securely offline until you're ready to reveal it.
- **Verify commitment hashes**: Before registering an asset, verify your commitment hash is correctly computed: `sha256(secret || blinding_factor)`
- **Use strong secrets**: Use cryptographically secure random values for secrets and blinding factors
- **Backup your keys**: Maintain secure backups of your Stellar wallet keys

### For Swap Participants

- **Verify swap details**: Always verify the asset ID, price, and counterparty before accepting a swap
- **Check expiry times**: Be aware of swap expiry times to avoid losing funds
- **Use the deployed contract**: Only interact with the verified, deployed `atomic_swap` contract address
- **Monitor transactions**: Review transaction details before signing

## Known Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. **No Token Escrow**: The current implementation does not escrow tokens during swaps. Payment is transferred to the contract but not held in escrow. This will be addressed in v1.1.

2. **Single Network**: Currently only supports Stellar testnet. Mainnet support is planned for v1.0.

3. **No Partial Disclosure**: The commitment scheme requires full secret revelation. Partial disclosure proofs are planned for v2.0.

4. **Gas Costs**: Complex operations may have higher gas costs. Optimization is ongoing.

5. **Frontend Not Included**: The current repository contains only smart contracts. A frontend UI is planned for v3.0.

### Security Assumptions

- Users maintain secure storage of their secrets and private keys
- The Stellar network operates as expected
- Soroban runtime is secure and bug-free
- Cryptographic primitives (SHA256) are secure

## Security Features

### Implemented

- ✅ Hiding commitment scheme so assets are registered without revealing their secret
- ✅ Atomic swap with key verification
- ✅ Authorization checks via `require_auth()`
- ✅ Duplicate commitment prevention
- ✅ Expiry-based cancellation for buyers
- ✅ Monotonic ID generation (upgrade-safe)

### Planned

- 🔄 Token escrow in atomic swaps
- 🔄 Multi-signature support
- 🔄 Time-locked commitments
- 🔄 Partial disclosure proofs

## API Server Audit Log

The API server (`api-server/src/audit.rs`) maintains a hash-chained
(HMAC-SHA256) audit log of commitment, swap, and admin events.

- **Durability**: every event is appended to a durable, append-only file and
  fsynced before the write is acknowledged. On startup, the store replays
  that file to resume the existing chain (`previous_signature` and
  `sequence`) instead of starting a new one — a process restart does not
  reset or fork the chain.
- **Key management**: `AUDIT_HMAC_KEY` must be set from durable
  configuration/secret storage. If it is absent, the server fails to start
  rather than silently signing the chain with a randomly generated,
  unrecoverable key.
- **Multi-instance safety**: concurrent instances sharing the same backing
  store coordinate appends through an exclusive file lock and always derive
  the next sequence number from the store's own current tail, so replicas
  behind a load balancer cannot assign colliding sequence numbers.
- **Independent verification**: `audit::verify_persisted_chain` walks the
  persisted file and confirms every signature matches its
  `previous_signature` linkage. It only needs read access to the backing
  file and the HMAC key, so an outside auditor can run it without any
  cooperation from a live server instance.

## Automated Security Scanning

Every push and pull request is scanned automatically in CI/CD:

- **Security scanning** — supply-chain policy (cargo-deny), secret detection
  (gitleaks), and static analysis. See [Security Scanning](docs/security-scanning.md).
- **Dependency vulnerability scanning** — cargo-audit + cargo-deny against the
  RustSec advisory database, plus Dependabot. See [Dependency Scanning](docs/dependency-scanning.md).
- **Code coverage enforcement** — a minimum coverage threshold is enforced in
  CI. See [Code Coverage](docs/code-coverage.md).
- **Mutation testing** — verifies the test suite catches logic errors. See
  [Mutation Testing](docs/mutation-testing.md).

Run all gates locally with `./scripts/security-checks.sh`.

## Security Audits

### Audit Status

- **Initial Review**: Internal security review completed
- **External Audit**: Planned for Q2 2026
- **Bug Bounty**: Planned for post-mainnet launch

### Audit Reports

Audit reports will be published in the [security-advisories](https://github.com/paul-motron/SwapIT/security/advisories) section after completion.

## Bug Bounty Program (Planned)

We plan to launch a bug bounty program after mainnet launch. Rewards will be based on severity:

- **Critical**: $5,000 - $25,000
- **High**: $1,000 - $5,000
- **Medium**: $500 - $1,000
- **Low**: $100 - $500

Details will be published at [bugbounty.swapit.io](https://bugbounty.swapit.io) when the program launches.
